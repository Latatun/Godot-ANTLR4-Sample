# Godot-ANTLR4-Sample

### STEPS
1. Download both `Antlr4.Runtime.Standard` and `Antlr4BuildTasks` from the package manager. Important to download the latest version of the former.
2. Add the configuration of the Antlr4 build like it's explained [here](https://github.com/kaby76/Antlr4BuildTasks?tab=readme-ov-file#setting-arguments-to-the-antlr-tool).
3. Run the build button at the top right corner in Godot to generate the files.
4. Then simply implement the desired class, cross-scripting was used in this example as it seemed easier overall.

### COMMENTS
Using the VSCODE add-on is still a valid solution, at least it works with the `Antlr4.Runtime.Standard` used in this example. This is just another approach.
